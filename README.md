Program description - 
[C] - 
1.c - Prints all 3 digit Armstrong numbers.
Note - If a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = abc (where 3 is the number of digits of the number 'abc') then abc is an Armstrong number.
2.c - Calculates v=u+ft when any one of the parameters is missing while the rest are given.
3.c - Convert a decimel number to it's binary equivalent.
4.c - Find out the factorial of a number.
5.c - Print the fibonacci series (using function).
6.c - Print the fibonacci series.
7.c - Print the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 2 numbers (using function).
8.c - Print the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 2 numbers
9.c - Find out the highest & lowest marks in an integer array of n marks.
10.c - Find the largest & 2nd largest number in an integer array.
11.c - Add 2 matrices.
12.c - Multiply 2 matrices.
13.c - Count the number of digits in a number.
14.c - Print all 3 digit Peterson numbers.
Note - If a! + b! + c! = abc then abc is a Peterson number. ! = factorial of a number.
15.c - Print all prime numbers between 1 & n.
Note - A number is a prime number if it is only divisible by 1 & itself.
16.c - Checks whether a number entered is a prime number. The number must be >0.
17.c - Prints the sum of digits in a number.
18.c - Insert an element at a given location in an array.
19.c - Delete an element from a given location in an array.
20.c - Program to implement Stack using arrays.
21.c - Program to implement Stack using structures.
22.c - Write a program in C to perform circular queue implementation using array.
23.c - Write a program in C to search an element in an array using Linear search algorithm.
24.c - Write a program in C to search an element in an array using Binary search algorithm.
