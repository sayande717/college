18.java - (Using Inheritence & Constructor) Find the area & volume of two rooms.
19.java - Define a class 'Shape' that initialises it's data members -  length & width. Another class 'Rectangle' is derived from the super  class 'Shape'. Write a program to display the area and perimeter of two 'rectangle' objects. //Not Done - Doubt
20.java - Define a class 'Triangle' with data members 'base' and 'height'. Write a program to display the area of the triangle using 'method overloading'.
21.java - Program to demonstrate method overriding. //Not done - Doubt
22.java - Write a program that declares a class name 'sphere'. It should have instance variables to record it's radius and coordinates (x,y,z) of it's centre. All instance variables should be of double data type. Use the 'new' operator to create the sphere object set and display it's instance variables. Use a. Default constructor & b. Argument constructor for the following program.
23.java - Write a program to find the volume and surface area of a box. Use functions with return types to calculate the volume & surface area. Also use argument constructor. Given - a. Volume = (H*W*D) and b. Surface Area = 2*(W*H+H*D+W*D).

30.java - Write a program that illustrates variable hiding. Class 'S' declares an instance variable 's' of integer type. Class 'T' declares an instance variable 'x' of String type, extending class 'S'. Instantiate both of these classes. Initialise and display the variable named 'x' with these objects.
31.java - Write the following program -
Class 'S1' - declares an instance variable named 's1' of type integer.
Class 'T1' - extends class 'S1' and declares an instance variable named 't1' of type integer.
Class 'U1' - extends class 'T1' and declares an instance variable named 'u1' of type integer.
These variables are initialised by the constructor for the class. The constructor displays a string, to indicate that it has started execution.
32.java - Program to demonstrate 'Dynamic Method Dispatch'.
33.java - Program to demonstrate an abstract class.
34.java - Define an abstract class 'Shape' and abstract method 'PrintArea'. Class 'Rectangle','Triangle' and 'Circle' are extended by shape. Write a Java program to display the area of rectangle, triangle and circle.
35.java - Write an application and interface name 'Shape2D' that declares getArea() method that calculates and returns the area of an enclosed 2D shape. Interface 'Shape3D' declares getVolume() method that calculates and returns the volume of an enclosed 3D shape. The abstract class 'Shape' declares an abstract method Display(), and is extended by class Circle and Sphere. Abstract class 'Shape' implements both 'Shape2D' and 'Shape3D'. Instantiate each of these classes and display the necessary information.
36.java - Write a program  with class 'Doctor' containing name and qualification of doctor, and another class 'Patient' with 2 field names, name and disease. Extend both the classes to 'Department' which contains department number and department name. An interface named as 'Hospital' contains two fields - Name of hospital and address. Using above classes and interface, get appropriate information and display it.
37.java - Write a program with class 'Teacher' containing two fields 'Name' and 'Qualification'. Extend the class to Department, which contains 'Department Number' and 'Department Name'. Define an interface named 'College' that contains 1 field, 'Name of the college'. Using the above classes and interface, get the appropriate information and display it.
38.java - Write a program where 4 types of exception, ie arithmetic exception, array index out of bounds exception, string index out of bounds exception, null pointer exception, using different cache blocks that handles the exception and ensures the program does not terminate, using 'finally' block.
39.java - Interface K1 declares method R and a variable R that is initialised by 1. Interface K2 extends K1 and declares R. Interface K3 extends K2 and declares R. R is of void type in all interfaces. Class 'U' implements Interface K3. If version of method 'R' displays the value of R, then Instantiate 'U' and invoke the method.
