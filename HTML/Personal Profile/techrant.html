            <font color='yellow'><br><b>A wise man once said, 'If you can imagine it, you can do it on Linux.'</b></font><br><br>
            So fasten your seat belts, and let me take you on the wild ride to my personal experience with tech (ie Linux for the most part). I've already talked about my Android phone and my experiences with it. Now let's talk about another amazing little device that changed my life forever. I had already started learning Linux seriously just after I flashed the custom ROM on my phone, primarily because Android is based on Linux and I was forced to use the terminal to tweak stuff from time to time. By the time I was in class 12, I was pretty comfortable with the terminal and hardly used the Linux GUI. My dream was to run a Linux server which I can use as a download manager, VPN server, DNS server, DHCP server, and a lot of other things. I finally found a way to make my dream come true without wasting too much money.<br>
            So let me introduce you to a server that fits in the palm of your hand, consumes 10-15 watts of power & has a quad core ARM64 (read ultra-efficient) CPU and is capable enough to run 2 4K displays while also supporting USB 3.0 & Gigabit Ethernet, in short, a very capable device. It's the Raspberry Pi. I got it a year ago. I took me a about half an hour to get Ubuntu Server up & running on it, and I've never been happier with it's performance and functionality. I tried a variety of stuff on it over the months, some notable ones include:
            <ol>
                <li>DNS Server aka the Internet phonebook.</li>
                <li>VPN Server (it's a hit or miss since VPN servers require a LOT of processing power).</li>
                <li>DLNA server (because I like to maintain my own personal music repository which I can enjoy even without Internet).</li>
                <li>NAS ie Network Attached Storage unit.</li>
                <li>DHCP Server (it currently leases out IP Addresses to devices on the Admin VLAN, while the guest & IoT VLAN's are handled by the router).</li>
                <li>Backend coding server (I made up the name, basically I connect Microsoft VS Code to it via SSH and code in a Linux environment).</li>
                <li>A central server to compress/uncompress files or anything that takes a lot of CPU power to get done, because it's more efficient that way.</li>
                <li>If anything requires a day or more ie a long time to complete, it's happening on the Pi, since it runs 24*7.</li>
                <li>RADIUS server (works in sync with my WPA2-Enterprise setup to authenticate clients on WiFi).</li>
                <li>git CLI (because the Github Desktop GUI for Windows is slow).</li>
                <li>Apache 2 Web Server. My ISP doesn't allow me to open ports to the Internet, so I just have a LAN only website showing my DNS server statistics.</li>
            </ol>
            Right now I'm making this website on VS Code remotely connected to my Raspberry Pi. I can't imagine living without this little but very capable Linux server. Currently I have Raspberry Pi OS loaded on it because I need a GUI for displaying the lab manuals of my college projects. It's hooked up to a 1080p monitor which just displays the GUI output when I need it to. Raspberry Pi OS provides one-line commands to turn on/off the HDMI ports, so it is a better fit for my current use case.<br><br>
            Lastly, allow me introduce you to my networking setup. It all started way back in class 4, when I was trying to tweak the WiFi signal of my single antenna D-Link DIR-600M 150mbps WiFi 4 router. I know it's a long name, but I have a habit of going technical whenever I can. Basically I was trying to figure out why the link speed on my mother's phone is 72mbps if the router supports 150mbps. After a little bit of research and I came across the most important statement related to networking:<br>
            <font color='yellow'><br><b>'Your network is only as fast as the weakest point in it.'</b></font><br><br>
            That one statement solved my problem. My mother's phone wasn't capable enough. But that somehow made me interested in networking, something I never thought of or cared about before. I started seeing YouTube videos and surfing on the Internet, learning all I could about how networks work. Fast forward to Class 9, and we finally upgraded our old 150mbps router to a brand new TP-Link Archer A7. 1750mbps WiFi 4 + 5, full Gigabit ports at the back, an USB-A port for anything you want to do, a whopping 128MB of RAM (the average home router has got about 32-64MB), a pretty capable ARM64 Qualcomm Atheros processor, it was all I needed to get started implementing whatever knowledge I had about this stuff. So I got started with it. The first thing I did was find a custom firmware. The reason? Versatility, freedom of customization, and the Linux terminal. I settled down on OpenWRT because it was difficult to use and required quite a learning curve to master.<br>
            It took me 3 years to get a firm grasp on all the basic stuff, and now I am pretty proud of the little network I built for myself. Let me just give you a glimpse of what it looks like currently - 
            <dl>
                <dt><font color="yellow"><b>1. The VLAN's </b><i>or "Virtual LAN's"</i>.</font>
                    <dd>There are 3 VLAN's in total, Admin, Guest & IoT. They are not physical LAN's, they're just there in order to separate the network into multiple segments, each with it's own network rules. In Brief, the Admin VLAN is the superuser network, it controls and can access everything else on the network. Devices on this VLAN are allowed to talk to each other and access the firewall. The IoT VLAN is isolated from all other VLAN's, devices on it can only talk to the Admin VLAN if the query is initiated by the Admin VLAN devices. This is necessary for LAN only devices like the printer to function properly. Lastly, there's the guest VLAN. Devices on this VLAN can't talk to each other, and also can't talk to anything on the IoT/Admin VLAN no matter what. It exists purely to give guests Internet access, and nothing more.</dd>
                <dt><font color="yellow"><b>2. The Firewall </b><i>aka the gatekeeper</i>.</font></dt>                    
                <dd>Configuring the firewall is at the top priority of anyone who manages a network. It scans all traffic and then decides what gets through and what doesn't. 100% of traffic is checked here. This means that even when I'm uploading a file to the Raspberry Pi from my desktop, every bit of data that goes through is scanned. This also means that more CPU cycles are used up unnecessarily, but for a security paranoid like me, this is normal stuff. The firewall also handles the traffic rules for the entire network. Things like the Guest VLAN are heavily locked down at all levels while everything (except malware) originating from the Admin VLAN is let in. This is the part of the network that I constantly keep configuring, because nothing is 100% secure at the end of the day. One notable thing the firewall does is block ICMP packets coming from the WAN side. This means that if you ping my public IP Address, you will not get a response back. That renders DDoS attacks useless and makes me less worthy of a target than someone who runs his router at default settings on stock firmware (let's face it, most of us run our routers like this).</dd>
                <dt><font color="yellow"><b>3. WiFi networks.</font></b></dt>
                <dd>So I have a total of 5 WiFi networks, each with their own use case. 2 for Admin, 2 for guest and 1 for IoT. The guest and IoT networks link to their respective VLAN's and run on WPA2-PSK, that is you provide the WiFi password and you're in. The Admin network runs on WPA2-Enterprise and has a TLS certificate based authentication system. In easy words, you need a digital certificate in order to connect to it. The reason I took the pain of setting up an enterprise network is because I needed it to have maximum security. On top of that, the Admin WiFi networks are heavily guarded with DCHP rules & MAC filtering so that no one other than the devices in the whitelist can connect to it.</dd>
                <dt><font color="yellow"><b>4. The Internet Gateway.</font></b></dt>
                <dd>The number of gateways=the number of VLAN's, unless someone manually creates multiple gateways/backdoors on the same VLAN (not sure why anyone would do that). I currently have 4 gateways because I have 4 VLAN's in total (taking into considering the WAN VLAN that connects to the Internet), out of which 3 are completely inaccessible. The Admin VLAN gateway is the only one that can be accessed, that too only from the Admin VLAN itself. There's no outside access. There are firewall rules setup in order to ward off people who might dare to for example ping my Guest VLAN gateway from the guest network. </dd>
                <dt><font color="yellow"><b>5. HTTPS/SSH</b> <i>everywhere</i></font></dt>
                <dd>HTTPS means a secure version of HTTP. I generated some self-signed certificates with the maximum encryption standard available, dropped it on the HTTPS server that my router hosts (ie the WebUI), and now I have a secure connection whenever I access my router's webUI. Talking about SSH, it's secure by default. It currently works on certificate based authentication which makes it even more secure.</dd>
                <dt><font color="yellow"><b>6. Simple gcc & python coding server.</font></b></dt>
                <dd>That's an off-topic thing, but since OpenWRT is Linux at the end of the day, I figured out that I can easily use it as a simple coding server much like my Raspberry Pi. Currently I just drop .c or .py files to /tmp, SSH to the router and use a terminal text editor like vi or nano to do my work. It works for all those brainstorming sessions when I suddenly find out a way to solve my code or a random problem but can't wait for VS Code to open at the same time. It works pretty well.</dd>
                </dt>
                All in all, I'm pretty happy with my current network setup. WPA3-SAE & WPA3-Enterprise is right around the corner, so a lot of work still needs to be done. But I'm pretty happy with my current setup. It doesn't feel as much frustating nowadays because I've finally mastered the basics, but there's definitely a lot of room for improvement.
            </dl>
            <br>That's pretty much all I have to say right now. I just hope I keep getting to experience new things in this fascinating world of technology. Thank you for coming along with me. Have a great day!
