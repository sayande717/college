            <b><font color="orange">Hello World!</font></b> I am Sayan De.<br>
            I'm a student pursuing B.Tech in IT from Haldia Institute of Technology. Since childhood I've been interested in all things technology. The first real exposure I got was back in class 7, when I suddenly stumbled upon an article on Android Central that talked about how to get started with Android custom ROM's. I found out that my phone was supported by LineageOS (ie the most popular custom ROM that exists), so I decided to flash it. It wasn't an easy process, but you can't literally unlock your phone's bootloader and expect things to be easy at the same time. I bricked my phone thrice, and after 8 days of trying, I eventually flashed my first custom ROM. Since then, there was no looking back. I still use custom ROM's on my phone, partly because I always have the latest Android update all the time to <i>take apart & destroy</i>, and partly because I've used them so much that the stock one feels severely limiting. It's like trying to use iOS after you've got the taste of what a rooted Android phone running a custom ROM on a custom Linux kernel can really do.<br>
            If you're more interested in knowing more about my personal <i>'tech'</i> adventures, <a href="techrant.html" style="color: white;">here's where I rant a bit more about it.</a><br><br>
            Talking about myself, I identify myself as a person laser focused on privacy & security and also an introvert who prefers chatting on the XDA Developer forums rather than talking to someone in person. I don't remember the last time I talked with my friends, and I hardly ever made friends with anyone by myself (ie it was always the other way round). So essentially I live in my own virtual world aka comfort zone, and I don't get out of it often. I just can't gather up enough interest to explore anything else other than technology.<br>
            My take on privacy & security is that it's a birthright everyone is entitled to, not some luxury or optional feature only select people can afford to have. I run a personal DNS server on my network and considering the amount of trackers and advertisements that get blocked every single day, I can pretty confidently say that privacy is a complete disaster in today's day & age. Almost every company wants to steal your data & make money from it. Everyone just wants to get richer and richer instead of working for a cleaner environment. The more integrated technology becomes, the worse it is for the environment. I don't mean to spread negativity by saying these things, but I don't like it and can go to any lengths to prevent anyone from tracking me. I also like to maintain a zero trust policy on the Internet.<br><br>
            Lastly, you may have noticed that I didn't talk about any other things or achievements or in fact anything other than technology. It's because I don't have anything to share from these domains. I'm taking some online courses and I'll definitely add them in the future, but currently it doesn't make sense to write fake fairy tales of how much I enjoyed this and that or how much I worked hard for a particular thing (no one gives you a certificate for running nmap and aircrack-ng on your Kali Linux CLI shell when you're studying in class 7, unfortunately), so I've just talked about my personal experiences instead.<br>
        Hope you have a good read,<br>
        Sayan De.
