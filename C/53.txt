Message queue creation

A message queue is used for passing small amount of information between processes in a structured manner A message queue is a linked list of messages stored within the kernel and identified by a message queue identifier. A new queue is created or an existing queue opened by msgget().

Sending process -> Message Passing queue
Message Passing queue -> Receiving process

msgget() - This function is used to create a message queue and will get a message queue identifier.

> Header file required for msgget(): #include<sys/msg.h>
> Syntax: int msgget(key_t key, int msgflg);
The msgget() function returns the message queue identifier associated with the argument key.
IPC_CREAT: It is used to create a message queue. Similarly, there are IPC_PRIVATE & IPC_EXCEL.

If msgflg specifies both IPC_CREAT & IPC_EXCEL and a message queue already exists for a particular queue, then the msgget() function fails with 'error number set2 exists', which means that the message queue is not created when the key is present.
Queue always returns integer value i.e. ID number of the queue. When the output is negative, it means that the queue is not created.
Perror: It explains the error code.
